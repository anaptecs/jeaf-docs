| `modelArtifactGroupID`                                         | The UML model can either be defined by pointing to the directory where the XMI files are located directly or by referencing an artifact that contains the XMI files. In case artifact referencing also a dependency to the artifact is required (see example below)The parameters are required in case of artifact referencing.
