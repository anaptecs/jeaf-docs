# UML Modeling Guide

This guide defines the UML modeling rules for projects using JEAF Generator. Purpose of this guide is to ensure a consistent, complete and high quality UML model. When using JEAF Generator it is mandatory to have such a high quality UML model as it is used as input for code generation. Benefit of this approach is to unburden developers from error-prone tasks like writing boiler blade code.

The guide is split into the following parts:

- [Short introduction into concepts and ideas of model-driven software development processes](model-driven-software-development)

- [Description of JEAF Generator Meta Model, which is the basis for UML modeling](/uml-modeling-guide/jmm/)

- [Description how components, services and other parts of an application have to be modeled](/uml-modeling-guide/modeling-how-tos)

- [Description of output that is generated by JEAF Generator](/developer-guide)

## Target audience

In JEAF Generator based projects the UML model is the center of the whole 
development process. Thus, this guide is strongly recommended for 
business analysts as well as software architects and developers.
