# Modeling How-Tos

This section describes how to define UML models in combination with JEAF Generator. In general there is no big difference to conventional UML models. However, due to the model driven approach, for some elements of the UML model it is required to add additional information. Therefore JEAF Generator defines a set of stereotypes that must be used to add required information to your model.

In order to simply modeling here is a list of how-tos that should provide an introduction for modeling in combination with JEAF Generator:

- [Common Modeling Guidelines](/uml-modeling-guide/common-modeling-guidelines/)

- [How to model (REST) Services APIs](/uml-modeling-guide/how-to-model-rest-service-apis/)

- [How to model POJOs](/uml-modeling-guide/how-to-model-pojos/)

- [How to model Domain Objects](/uml-modeling-guide/how-to-model-domain-objects/)

- [How to use Java Bean Validation (JSR 380)](/uml-modeling-guide/how-to-use-java-bean-validation/)

- [How to publish REST Services as OpenAPI 3 specification](/uml-modeling-guide/how-to-model-open-api/)

- [How to model Object Mappings](/uml-modeling-guide/how-to-model-object-mappings/)

- [How to model Security Roles](/uml-modeling-guide/how-to-model-security-roles/)

- [How to model Activities](/uml-modeling-guide/how-to-model-activities/)
