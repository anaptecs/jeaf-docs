# Features

JEAF Generator realizes the link between UML models and code.It is designed for enterprise projects and offers a large set of features to implement scalable, high-load, high-performance applications. 

JEAF Generator is provided as Maven Plugin. All required configurations can be done through the plugin configuration.

<br>

## Supported UML Modeling Tools

JEAF Generator uses UML models to generate code and configurations for various cases and target platforms. No matter what is the expected output, an UML model is always the input.

Currently the following UML modeling tools are supported: <sup>1)</sup>

* [**MagicDraw UML** (commercial)](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/no-magic/magicdraw/)
* [**Eclipse Papyrus** (Open Source)](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.mdt.papyrus)

<br>

<sup>1)</sup> *Enterprise Architect from Sparx Systems is not supported as it does not support the full UML 2.5 feature set. Unfortunately, some of the missing features are mandatory when you want to set up a feature rich, high quality model-driven process.*
